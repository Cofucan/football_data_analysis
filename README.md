# Investigating A Dataset

## An analysis of european soccer/football from 2008 to 2016

This dataset was acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer) and it is an extensive dataset of soccer matches that was scraped from various online sources.

In this project, I take a deep dive into the dataset to see what questions can be answered. My findings are detailed in the Jupyter notebook.
