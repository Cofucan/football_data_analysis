# Investigating A Dataset

## An analysis of european soccer/football from 2008 to 2016

This dataset was acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer) and it is an extensive dataset of soccer matches that was scraped from various online sources.

In this project, I take a deep dive into the dataset to see what questions can be answered. My findings are documented in the Jupyter notebook.
You wiil need to have the sqlite file to be able to run the notebook on your machine.
